# TweetSentimentAnalysis
Trained a logistic regression model from a labeled data to predict whether a tweet is positive or negative. 
The repo has a google colab folder with all the steps I took to train and test the model.
## What I learned

[] Getting rid of unnecessary text from our data set to ensure only the required text is incuded in the analysis
[] checking for biasness and null values 
[] Stemming
[] Converting textual data to numerical or feature extraction and data spilitting into test and train data
[] Model training on training data and model evaluation and calculating accuracy score
